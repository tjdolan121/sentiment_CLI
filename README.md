# ML API: Simple CLI tool for Sentiment Analysis

## Enter a sentence, see if it leans "good" or "bad".

#### PURPOSE: I am exploring different ways to deliver machine learning products to end users.

#### In this project, I built a simple CLI tool for sentiment analysis as a first step in this exploration.
#### The model used is a simple Naive Bayes classifier from Scikit-learn.
#### My next venture will be integrating this model into a Flask application.

### Usage:

NOTE: Project requires Python 3

STEP 1: Clone the project (in the terminal): ```git clone git@github.com:tjdolan121/sentiment_CLI.git```

STEP 2: Create a new virtual environment: ```virtualenv venv```

STEP 3: Activate the virtual environment: ```source venv/bin/activate```

STEP 4: Navigate to the project directory, "Sentiment_CLI"

STEP 5: Install requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

STEP 6: Run the main program: ```python3 main_program.py```

##### As always, feedback and contributions are welcome!
